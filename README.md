## ✨ Features

- 🔊 **Audio Output Switcher**  
  Easily select your desired audio device from a dropdown list (ComboBox) of currently available outputs.

  Adjust the system volume using a smooth mouse-drag-enabled progress bar (0–100%).

- ⚙️ **Popup Menu Options**  
  - **Start with Windows**  
  - **Stay on Top**

- 🧼 **Minimal UI**  
  - The title bar hides automatically when the widget is inactive to stay out of your way.
  - Lightweight and fast — the audio device list and volume level only refresh when the widget regains focus (via mouse), reducing unnecessary updates.
